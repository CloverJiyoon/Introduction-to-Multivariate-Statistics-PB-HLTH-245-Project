*Comment:*

The one player who currently does not have club position is Didier Drogba. He is not belonged to any club at that moment when the FIFA made ratings. However, since I know him a striker, I will record him as a striker. 

As we found above, there are 30 different positions shown. However, "Sub" and "Res" are not really the position we can deal with. The one way to deal with this problem is to assign the rows of "Sub" and "Res" players (for club position), and try to find the national positions of these players. 

After that, I can combine CB, LB, LCB, LWB, RB, RCB, and RWB into defense position. I can combine CAM, CDM, CM, LAM, LCM, LDM, LM, RAM, RCM, RDM, and RM into midfielder position. I can combine CF, LF, LS, LW, RF, RS, RW, and ST.
