# PH245
Public Health 245 Final project

Executive summary:
* Our team has believed that FIFA rating has been somewhat biased, and we decided to inspect 17588 playersâ€™ ratings that we
downloaded from Kaggle.
* We decided to examine whether ratings were different based on positions and preferred foot of the players using Two-way
MANOVA, how quantitative variables were related with the rating using linear regression, and find how each variable was
correlated each other using PCA. (we believe the order of our analysis should be Two-way MANOVA -> linear regression -> PCA)
* We concluded that FIFA ratings were not 100% fairly evaluated, and it would be better for people not use FIFA ratings to
compare players with different positions. So, FIFA ratings should be used to compare players in the same positions and types.
